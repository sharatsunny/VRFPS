# VRFPS
 
VRFPS, Titled VRFPS as we coouldn't think of a better name, this game was originally made for the oculus rift, it was part of a group project for my final year of university but due to time constraints while the rest of the group focused on the main project I took it upon myself to create this VR, just a simple first person endless shooter, nothing complicated
